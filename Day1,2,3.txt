DAY - 1

Source code Vs Object Code : 
•	Source code is the human understandable set of instructions that is written by a programmer in a .java file. 
•	Object code is the intermediate code generated by the jdk when the source code is compiled.
Using Compiler with flags :
•	We can use debug mode in eclipse and identify breakpoints , show that we can check the contents of variables while compilation.
Keywords, Variables :
•	Keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the programming language. Keywords cannot be used as names of variables, methods, classes or any other identifiers.
•	A variable is a data item that may take one or more values during the runtime of a programme. Variables, in combination with data types are used to store various types of data.
Variable scope, lifetime, life time, initial value, modifiers :
•	Scope tells us in which part of a program a variable is visible or active. A variable cannot be accessed outside its scope. Limiting the scope of variable ensures that changes inside the function can’t affect the main program in unexpected ways.
•	Lifetime of a variable is the time during which the variable stays in memory and is accessible during program execution. A local variable is created the moment the method is activated and is destroyed when the method finishes executing.
•	Initial Value is the default value of the variable’s data type or a specific value given to the variable during declaration.
•	Access modifiers are keywords in java that set the accessibility of classes, methods, variables, etc.
Programming Constructs (Selection construct and loop constructs) :
•	A selection statement provides for selection between alternatives. If statement, if – else statement and the switch statement are considered as selection constructs/statements.
•	A looping statement causes a group of one or more statements to be invoked repeatedly until some end condition is met. For, while and do – while are looping constructs/statements.
Declare Array :
•	An array is a group of like – typed values that are referred to by a common name.
•	In java, array can be declared in 2 ways :-
o	Type variable[];
o	Type[] variable;
Store data in array and process elements :
•	 Assigning values to an element in an array can be done by simply referencing an individual element of an array using the array name and the index inside parentheses, then use the assignment operator (=) followed by a value.
•	Looping statements are generally used to store data into an array.

DAY - 2

Pointers, Declare and Initialize pointers :
•	a pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware.
•	Java does not allow programmers to use pointers to avoid unsafe code.
Function definitions/invocations :
•	A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
•	Function calling is when you call a function yourself in a program. While function invoking is when it gets called automatically. 
Call functions by passing values and addresses :
•	The call by reference method of passing arguments to a function copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. It means the changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.
•	The call by value method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
Dynamic memory allocation/de allocation :
•	Dynamic variables are not declared with ordinary variable declarations; they are explicitly allocated and deallocated at run time. Memory allocation is accomplished using the new operator and deallocation is accomplished using the delete operator.
Memory leakage :
•	Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it.
•	 a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. 
User Defined Structures: 
•	Very roughly speaking, a structure is a little bit like an array. An array is a collection of associated values, all of the same type. A structure is a collection of associated values, but the values can all have different types.
Access data members : 
•	The data members and member functions of class can be accessed using the dot('. ') operator with the object.

Dynamic memory allocation for user defined structures :
•	
Array of pointers :
•	an array of pointers is an indexed set of variables, where the variables are pointers (referencing a location in memory). The value of each integer is printed by dereferencing the pointers
Iterate on array of pointers :
•	An array of pointers can be iterated through by using looping statements just like a normal array. Difference is, each element of an array of pointers points to the location of a value or variable.

DAY - 3

Implement Data Structures :
•	Data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification of data.
•	Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
Linked List :
•	A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
•	Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous locations, the elements are linked using pointers. Each node of list has data and a reference to the next node.
Stack :
•	A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations : push and pop.
•	It follows last in first out principal.
Queue :
•	A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and removal of entities from the other end of sequence.
•	It follows first in first out principal.
Binary Tree :
•	A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each element has at most two child nodes.
•	It is used to store information that naturally form a hierarchy.
