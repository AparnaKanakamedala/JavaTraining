// Implementing queue as an array -> Algorithm

-> Declare queue[], front and rear as global variables.
-> Set front and rear of queue as 0.
-> Set initial capacity of queue as 5.
-> Create a method called Enqueue that accepts data as parameter
			->if capacity is equal to rear, then print queue is full.
			->else add new data to queue[rear].
-> create a method called Dequeue.
			->if front and rear are same, then print queue is empty.
			->shift all elements to the right by one till rear is reached.
			->if rear exceeds capacity, then store queue[rear] as zero.
->Call Enqueue method 2-3 times with different data.
-> print the elements of the queue.
->Call Dequeue method once and print the elements to see if the rear element is deleted or not.
