//LINKED LIST LOGIC

// -------1. Add last-------

-> Iterate through the existing list till the next pointer of a node is null.
-> Change the next pointer from null to point to the address of the new node E.
-> Set the next pointer of new node E to null.

//-------2. Add First-------

-> Check the head pointer for address of the first node.
-> Set the new node E's next pointer to the address of first node pointed by head pointer.
-> Change the head pointer to from the previous first node to the new first node E.

//-------3. Add E after B-------

->Search the linked list until the node B is found.
->Copy the address stored in the next pointer of B into the next pointer of new node E.
->Change the address stored in next pointer of B to address of new node E.

//-------4. Remove(object/index)-------

->Search the linked list until the node with object/index is found (Assume this node is O).
->Copy the address stored in the next pointer of node O into the next pointer of the node preceding node O.
->Node O is removed from the linked list.
